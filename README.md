# Add Loan Form 🏦

This project provides a simple, well-structured HTML form for adding new loan entries, complemented by modern and responsive CSS for an intuitive user interface.

---

## ✨ Overview

The "Add Loan" form is designed to collect various details required for a loan application, including loan product selection, borrower information, unique loan numbers, and custom fields for banking and guarantor details. The form is styled to be clean, user-friendly, and adaptable to different screen sizes.

## 📂 Files

* `index.html`: Contains the semantic HTML structure of the "Add Loan" form.
* `addLoan.css`: Provides all the styling for the form, making it visually appealing and responsive.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Clean Structure**: The HTML is organized into logical sections (`form-section`, `custom-fields-section`) for better readability and maintainability.
* **Responsive Design**: The CSS ensures the form looks good and functions well on both large screens (desktops) and smaller devices (tablets and mobile phones). 📱💻
* **Styled Form Elements**: Custom styling for `select` dropdowns, `input` fields, and `buttons` for a consistent look.
* **Required Field Indicators**: Asterisks (`*`) clearly mark mandatory fields, making it easy for users to identify necessary information. These asterisks are intentionally **bold and dark red** for high visibility.
* **Action Buttons**: Dedicated buttons for "Cancel" and "Save Loan" facilitate user interaction.

## 🎨 Customization

You can easily customize the appearance of the form by modifying the `addLoan.css` file:

* **Color Scheme**: Adjust the CSS variables defined in `:root` (e.g., `--heading-color`, `--cta-background-color`) to match your brand's color palette. 🌈
* **Font Styles**: Change `font-family` properties to use different fonts.
* **Layout**: Modify flexbox properties within `.form-group` and media queries to alter the form's layout.
* **Asterisk Styling**: The `color`, `font-weight`, and `font-size` of the `.required-asterisk` class can be tweaked further if needed. ✨
